<!--# Approach Taken (Thought process & methods of producing it, show where you took the lead)
I started this project when i first began my python bootcamp. i created the site originally just using basic html and css to begin with, but then when i came back to the site after completing my web development bootcamp i decided to remove the python packages and add react to allow the site access to the vast react library. -->
