# Overview & Concept
The idea of this project is to showcase my abilities as a developer, with the purpose of gaining employment.

# Technologies Used
In this project I used Html,Javascript,Css,react-bootstrap,Node and React using fontawesome for fonts.


<!--# Approach Taken (Thought process & methods of producing it, show where you took the lead)
I started this project when i first began my python bootcamp. i created the site originally just using basic html and css to begin with, but then when i came back to the site after completing my web development bootcamp i decided to remove the python packages and add react to allow the site access to the vast react library. -->
