# Deployed Project Link

# Overview & Concept
The idea of this project is to showcase my abilities as a developer, with the purpose of gaining employment. This is one of 

# Technologies Used
In this project i used React and Bulma for the front end aswell as using Js for the functionality of the site and its buttons.
  The icons were imported from react-icons and the fonts from fontawesome.

# Approach Taken (Thought process & methods of producing it, show where you took the lead)
I started this project when i first began my python bootcamp. i created the site just using html and css basics to begin with, but then when i came back to the site after completing my web development bootcamp i decided to change to add react to the site making it easier to build.
